There is a bug in the `add_categories` method of the `SchemaGenerator` class. The bug is in the `get_category` method where it is not correctly determining the category for each endpoint based on the paths and categories.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `get_category` method as follows:

```python
def get_category(self, categories, path):
    path_components = path.split("{")[0].strip('/').split('/')
    for path_component in path_components:
        if path_component in categories:
            return path_component
    return None
```

This modification ensures that the correct category is determined for each endpoint based on the paths and categories.
