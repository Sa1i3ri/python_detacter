Based on the provided code, I can point out several potential issues and improvements. Here are the problematic areas along with their line numbers:

1. **Handling Non-Integer Environment Variables in `env_integer`**:
   - **Lines 10-13**: If the environment variable is present but cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., it contains non-numeric characters), the program will raise a `ValueError`, which isn't caught. This could lead to unexpected crashes.
   ```python
   def env_integer(key, default):
       if key in os.environ:
           return int(os.environ[key])  # Potential ValueError here
       return default
   ```

2. **Boolean Environment Variable Handling**:
   - **Lines 17-21**: Similar to `env_integer`, this function does not handle cases where the environment variable is present but not a valid string ("true" or "false"). This can also lead to unexpected behavior.
   ```python
   def env_bool(key, default):
       if key in os.environ:
           return True if os.environ[key].lower() == "true" else False  # Potential issue
       return default
   ```

3. **Invalid Memory Unit Requests**:
   - **Lines 47-51**: The `to_memory_units` function raises a `ValueError` if the requested memory is less than `MEMORY_RESOURCE_UNIT_BYTES`. This is okay, but if the caller of this function does not handle the exception, it could lead to unhandled exceptions.
   ```python
   if value < 1:
       raise ValueError(
           "The minimum amount of memory that can be requested is {} bytes, "
           "however {} bytes was asked.".format(MEMORY_RESOURCE_UNIT_BYTES,
                                                memory_bytes))
   ```

4. **Logging Format as Hardcoded String**:
   - **Line 91**: The logging format should ideally be configurable and not hardcoded, to improve flexibility. However, this is more of a design concern rather than a bug.
   ```python
   LOGGER_FORMAT = (
       "%(asctime)s\t%(levelname)s %(filename)s:%(lineno)s -- %(message)s")
   ```

5. **Potential Environmental Misconfiguration**:
   - **Various Lines**: The environment variables fetched through `env_integer` and `env_bool` do not have a fallback mechanism. If they're not set, the default values are used, but if the environment variable is present but invalid, it could lead to critical failures.

### Summary of Buggy Segments:
- **Lines 10-13**: `env_integer` function
- **Lines 17-21**: `env_bool` function
- **Lines 47-51**: `to_memory_units` function

To fix these issues, consider adding error handling around the integer conversions and ensuring the boolean conversion is robust against unexpected input.
