Here are some potential issues in the provided code, along with their corresponding line numbers:

1. **Line 39-40 (KeyError on `id_vars` check)**:
   The error message for missing `id_vars` should use an f-string for better clarity and formatting. The current way may not display the missing indices correctly.

   ```python
   raise KeyError(
       "The following 'id_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {missing}"
       "".format(missing=list(missing))
   )
   ```
   Change to:
   ```python
   raise KeyError(
       f"The following 'id_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {list(missing)}"
   )
   ```

2. **Line 134 (KeyError on `value_vars` check)**:
   Similar to the previous point, the error message should also use an f-string for consistency.

   ```python
   raise KeyError(
       "The following 'value_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {missing}"
       "".format(missing=list(missing))
   )
   ```
   Change to:
   ```python
   raise KeyError(
       f"The following 'value_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {list(missing)}"
   )
   ```

3. **Line 195 (Setting `var_name`)**:
   If `frame.columns.names` is `None`, `len(frame.columns.names)` raises an error. This could occur with non-MultiIndex columns. A safer approach would be to check if `frame.columns.names` is not `None`.

   ```python
   if len(frame.columns.names) == len(set(frame.columns.names)):
   ```
   This should be preceded by a check for `None`.

4. **Line 419 (KeyError in `wide_to_long`)**:
   In the `get_var_names` function, if no columns match the regex, an empty list is returned, which could lead to issues later when attempting to process those results. Ensure that `value_vars_flattened` is not empty before proceeding.

   ```python
   if not value_vars_flattened:
       raise ValueError("No columns matched the provided stubnames.")
   ```

5. **Line 426 (Error when merging)**:
   The code does not handle potential merge errors, such as when the merge keys do not align. It would be prudent to add a check here to ensure that the merge can be performed successfully, or handle the exception if it occurs.

### Summary of Line Numbers:
- 39-40 (KeyError on `id_vars`)
- 134 (KeyError on `value_vars`)
- 195 (Setting `var_name`)
- 419 (Check for empty `value_vars_flattened`)
- 426 (Handle potential merge errors)

These points should help you improve the robustness of your code.
