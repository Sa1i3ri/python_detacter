To delve into potential issues in your code, I see a few areas that could lead to bugs:

1. **Error Logging**: In the `render_token_login_page` function, the `user_id` variable might not be defined if an exception occurs before it's set, which would cause a `NameError`. This can happen in the `NoResultFound` exception block.

   - **Line 290**: `logger.exception("Bad user id in token. Token= , User id= %s, Org=%s", user_id, token, org_slug)`

2. **Repeated Code**: The same logic is repeated in the `invite`, `reset`, and `verify` functions. If a bug exists in the validation or rendering logic, it would propagate to all three functions.

3. **Direct User Modification**: In the `login` function, directly modifying `user` without checking for potential state changes or thread safety issues could lead to bugs.

   - **Line 206**: `user.hash_password(request.form["password"])`

To summarize, focus on the error handling for `user_id` in line 290 and consider refactoring the repeated logic across your routes.
