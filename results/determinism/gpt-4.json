Cross-site scripting is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications that enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. \n\nIn this code, user input is taken from a form and used in a SQL query, but it is parameterized, which prevents SQL injection attacks. The user input is also returned in the response, but it is not being inserted into the HTML in a way that would allow for script execution. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while this code may not have an XSS vulnerability, it could still be vulnerable to other types of attacks. For example, if the 'title' or 'author' fields are displayed elsewhere in the application without proper output encoding, it could potentially lead to an XSS vulnerability. \n\nAlso, the code does not handle errors that might occur when connecting to the database or executing the SQL query. It's a good practice to handle these potential errors to prevent application crashes or unexpected behavior.",
