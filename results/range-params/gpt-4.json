An attacker can send a malicious script as the `day` parameter which will be executed when the HTML is rendered on the client side.\n\nTo fix this, you should escape the `day` parameter before including it in the HTML string. Flask provides the `escape` function for this purpose. Here is the fixed code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, escape\nimport sqlite3\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef create_output(result, day):\n    output = \"<p>On \" + escape(day) + \" the following doctors are available: \"\n    for row in result:\n        output += escape(row[1]) + \"\\n\"\n    output += \"</p>\"\n    return output\n\n@app.route('/doctor', methods=['POST'])\ndef find_doctor():\n    day = request.form['day']\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('availability.db')\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM availability WHERE day=?\", (day,))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n    result = cur.fetchall()\n    output = create_output(result, day)\n    return output\n```\n\nIn the fixed code, the `escape` function is used to sanitize the `day` parameter and the doctor's name before they are included in the HTML string. This will prevent any malicious scripts from being executed.",

Input sanitization: The script uses the 'escape' function from the 'markupsafe' module when formatting the 'day' string into HTML content. This function replaces HTML special characters to their escape equivalent, preventing HTML tags from being executed, effectively reducing the risk of an XSS attack.\n\n2.

This is a common location for XSS attacks.\n\nHowever, one area of concern is the creation of the 'output' string. It's concatenating 'row[1]', apparently from a database result, directly into HTML content. If 'row[1]' could be user-supplied data that makes it into the 'availability' database, you'd have a potential for stored XSS attacks.\n\nTo prevent this, the 'row[1]' data should also be escaped similarly to 'day' before being included in the 'output' string.

The part of the code that makes it vulnerable is this:\n\n```python\nquery_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s' AND password = '%s'\"\nparmeters = (username, password)\nquery = query_text, parmeters\n```\n\nHere, the `username` and `password` values are directly inserted into your SQL query. This allows an attacker to input a specially crafted string for `username` or `password` to alter the query and access, modify, or delete information in the database that they would not otherwise be able to.\n\nTo fix this issue, use parameterized queries instead. In pymysql, you can do that like this:\n\n```python\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s\"\nparms = (username, password)\ncursor.execute(query, parms)\n```\n\nUsing this method, PyMySQL automatically escapes the `username` and `password` parameters, which prevents any SQL injection attacks.",

The function `createQuery()` inserts the username and password directly into the SQL query without any proper sanitization or parameterized query handling. This means that if the user input includes SQL code, that code will be executed as part of the query, creating a security vulnerability.\n\nA user could potentially use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands. For instance, the user could enter a username like `'a'; DROP TABLE users; --` to delete the users table, or `'; SELECT * FROM users; --` to display all users. This is a critical security risk.\n\nA more secure way to handle SQL queries would be to make use of parameterized queries or prepared statements, which ensure the SQL query structure doesn't get affected by user input, thus preventing SQL injection attacks.\n\nHere's how the code can be updated to mitigate this risk:\n\n```python\ndef createQuery(username, password):\n  query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s\"\n  parmeters = (username, password)\n  return query_text, parmeters\n\n@app.route(\"/login\")\ndef login():\n  username = request.form.get('username')\n  password = request.form.get('password')\n\n  db = pymysql.connect(\"localhost\")\n  cursor = db.cursor()\n\n  query, parameters = createQuery(username, password)\n  cursor.execute(query, parameters)  # Safe parameters in query\n\n  record = cursor.fetchone()\n  if record:\n    session['logged_user'] = username\n    return \"<p>Logged in!</p>\"\n  db.close()\n```\nNote: It's ideal to use hashing techniques while dealing with passwords, rather than storing or comparing them in plain text.",

This means that a malicious user could potentially manipulate the SQL code to extract sensitive information from the database, execute unwanted actions, etc.\n\nIn the function `createQuery`, the code is directly interpolating provided username and password into the query string using format specifiers (`'%s'`). This poses a significant risk as sophisticated users could provide input data that could modify the SQL command to be executed.\n\nHere is how the function can be modified to avoid SQL injection:\n\n```python\ndef createQuery(username, password):\n  query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s\"\n  parmeters = (username, password)\n  return (query, parmeters)\n```\n\nAlso, the way you're executing the query needs to be adjusted to deal with the parameters separately:\n\n```python\n@app.route(\"/login\", methods=['POST'])\ndef login():\n  username = request.form['username']\n  password = request.form['password']\n\n  db = pymysql.connect(\"localhost\")\n  cursor = db.cursor()\n\n  query, params = createQuery(username, password)\n  cursor.execute(query, params)\n\n  record = cursor.fetchone()\n  if record:\n    session['logged_user'] = username\n    return \"<p>Logged in!</p>\"\n  db.close()\n```\n\nNote: This example assumes username and password are sent in a POST request, hence `methods=['POST']` has been added to the `@app.route` decorator and `request.form['username']` & `request.form['password']` is used to access the POST parameters.\n\nThis mitigates SQL Injection by treating user provided strings as literal data to be compared with column values, instead of portions of the SQL command. This practice of separating SQL commands and data is commonly known as 'Query Parameterization'.",
