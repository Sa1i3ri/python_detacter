The patched code ensures that only serialized data from trusted sources is deserialized. It includes a validation step to check the integrity of the data structure (e.g., verifying specific keys). Additionally, using a safer mechanism like encoding/decoding serialized data with base64 makes it harder to tamper with the serialized input.
