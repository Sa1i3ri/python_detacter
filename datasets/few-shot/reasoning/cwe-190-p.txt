The patched code introduces a check before performing the multiplication to ensure the product of width and height does not exceed the maximum allowable integer size (sys.maxsize). This prevents integer overflow and ensures the calculation is performed safely. If the check fails, the program outputs an error message instead of attempting the calculation.
