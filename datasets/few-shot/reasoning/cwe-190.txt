The vulnerable code directly calculates the product of width and height without considering whether the multiplication could exceed the maximum integer size supported by the system. This can lead to an integer overflow, causing the result to wrap around and produce an incorrect or unexpected value. For example, on systems where integers are 32-bit, multiplying two large values could cause the area to wrap around to a small or negative value.
