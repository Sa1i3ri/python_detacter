The vulnerable code directly accepts user input without any validation to check if the input is an integer or falls within the acceptable range of 1 to 149. This leads to two primary issues:

1.If the user inputs a non-numeric value, the int() function will raise a ValueError and crash the program.
2.If the user inputs a value outside the acceptable range, the program will print an invalid message but does not prevent further issues or ensure data correctness.
