The patched code enforces an input size limit (MAX_SIZE) to ensure that user input cannot exceed a manageable length. This prevents excessive resource consumption. Additionally, the multiplier in the processing step has been significantly reduced to further minimize resource usage. These measures protect the system from resource exhaustion and potential DoS attacks.
