The patched code uses the PBKDF2 algorithm with SHA-256, a strong cryptographic hash function. It also includes a random salt, which ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different. The use of multiple iterations (e.g., 100,000) significantly increases computational complexity, making brute force attacks infeasible.
