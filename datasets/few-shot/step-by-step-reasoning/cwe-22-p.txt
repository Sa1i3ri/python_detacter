Overview:
The function takes a file name as input, validates the file path, and reads the file content only if the path is safe.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept a file name from user input.
S2: Construct the full file path by combining base_dir and file_name.
S3: Validate the file path to ensure it remains within base_dir.
S4: Open the file if validation passes.

Analysis:
A-S1: The program resolves the absolute path of the constructed file_path.
A-S2: It validates the absolute path to ensure it starts with base_dir, effectively blocking path traversal attempts.
A-S3: If the validation fails, the program denies access and prevents potential attacks.

Decision:
The patched code prevents path traversal attacks by validating the resolved file path.
