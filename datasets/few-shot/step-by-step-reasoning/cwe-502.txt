Overview:
The function deserializes user-provided data and displays the resulting object.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept serialized data as user input.
S2: Deserialize the data using pickle.loads.
S3: Display the deserialized object.

Analysis:
A-S1: The input is accepted without validation or checks.
A-S2: Using pickle.loads allows the execution of arbitrary code embedded in the serialized data.
A-S3: The function assumes the deserialized object is safe without verification, increasing security risks.

Decision:
The vulnerable code does not protect against deserialization attacks, making it unsafe for untrusted inputs.
