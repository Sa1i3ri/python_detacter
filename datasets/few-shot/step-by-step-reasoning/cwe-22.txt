Overview:
The function takes a file name as input and reads the content of the file in the base_dir.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept a file name from user input.
S2: Construct the full file path by concatenating base_dir and file_name.
S3: Open the file located at the constructed path.

Analysis:
A-S1: The program does not validate the file name for malicious sequences like ../.
A-S2: If the user provides ../ in the input, the program concatenates it with base_dir, allowing access to files outside the intended directory.

Decision:
The vulnerable code allows path traversal attacks because it does not validate the user-provided file name.
