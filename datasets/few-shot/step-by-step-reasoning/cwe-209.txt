Overview:
The function retrieves user information from the database and handles errors by returning the exception message to the user.

Sub-components:
S1: Retrieve user information from the database using the user_id.
S2: Handle errors by catching exceptions.
S3: Return the exception message directly to the user.

Analysis:
A-S1: The function performs a database query based on user input.
A-S2: If an error occurs (e.g., invalid input or database issues), the exception is caught.
A-S3: The exception message is included in the response, exposing sensitive internal details to the user.

Decision:
The vulnerable code exposes internal information, which attackers could exploit to gather details about the system.
