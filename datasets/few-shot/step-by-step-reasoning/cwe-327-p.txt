Overview:
The function hashes a user-provided password securely using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 and a random salt.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept a plaintext password from the user.
S2: Generate a random salt to ensure hash uniqueness.
S3: Use PBKDF2 with SHA-256 to hash the password and salt.
S4: Store or display the resulting hash and salt.

Analysis:
A-S1: The plaintext password is processed securely.
A-S2: A random salt ensures that each hash is unique, even for identical passwords.
A-S3: PBKDF2 with SHA-256 is a strong and modern hashing algorithm that resists brute force and precomputed attacks due to its computational cost.
A-S4: The resulting hash and salt can be stored securely for later authentication.

Decision:
The patched code uses modern cryptographic best practices, making it resistant to attacks.
