Overview:
The function calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its width and height.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept width and height as user inputs.
S2: Calculate the product of width and height.

Analysis:
A-S1: User inputs are accepted as integers without validation.
A-S2: The product of two large integers may exceed the maximum integer size, leading to an overflow or wraparound.

Decision:
The vulnerable code does not protect against integer overflow, leading to potential miscalculations and unsafe behavior.
