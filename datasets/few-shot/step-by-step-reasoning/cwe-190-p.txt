Overview:
The function calculates the area of a rectangle while ensuring the multiplication is safe.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept width and height as user inputs.
S2: Check if the multiplication of width and height will result in an overflow.
S3: Perform the multiplication if the check passes.

Analysis:
A-S1: User inputs are accepted as integers.
A-S2: The program checks if width * height exceeds sys.maxsize. If true, it terminates the operation to prevent overflow.
A-S3: If the check passes, the multiplication is performed, ensuring a correct and safe result.

Decision:
The patched code prevents integer overflow by performing a pre-check, ensuring safe execution.
