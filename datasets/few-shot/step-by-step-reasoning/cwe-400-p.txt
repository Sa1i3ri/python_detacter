Overview:
The function limits input size and reduces processing to avoid excessive resource consumption.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept user input and validate its length.
S2: Process the input with a reduced repetition multiplier.
S3: Display part of the processed result.

Analysis:
A-S1: The input size is validated against a defined maximum (MAX_SIZE), ensuring inputs remain manageable.
A-S2: The reduced repetition multiplier (* 1000) minimizes the risk of resource exhaustion during processing.
A-S3: Displaying a portion of the result ensures the function remains efficient while providing meaningful feedback.

Decision:
The patched code prevents uncontrolled resource consumption and mitigates the risk of DoS attacks.
