Overview:
The program accepts user input for age and prints whether it is valid.

Sub-components:
S1: Read user input using input().
S2: Convert the input to an integer using int().
S3: Check if the age is within the range 1 to 149.

Analysis:
A-S1: The input() function directly accepts raw user input, which could be non-numeric.
A-S2: The int() function does not handle invalid input gracefully, leading to program crashes.
A-S3: The range check is applied, but invalid input outside the range is not prevented before processing.

Decision:
The vulnerable code does not validate the input type and range properly, making it prone to crashes and incorrect data processing.
