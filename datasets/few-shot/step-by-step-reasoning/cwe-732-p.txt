Overview:
The function creates a file with explicitly defined secure permissions and writes sensitive data to it.

Sub-components:
S1: Create the file.
S2: Write sensitive data to the file.
S3: Set restrictive permissions to limit access to the file owner.

Analysis:
A-S1: The file is created.
A-S2: Sensitive data is written to the file.
A-S3: The permissions are set to allow only the owner to read and write, ensuring data security.

Decision:
The patched code secures sensitive data by explicitly setting restrictive permissions.
