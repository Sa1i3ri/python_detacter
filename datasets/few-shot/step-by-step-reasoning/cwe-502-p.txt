Overview:
The function securely deserializes user-provided data after validating its structure.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept serialized data from a trusted source.
S2: Validate the structure of the deserialized object against expected criteria.
S3: Display the deserialized object if validation passes.

Analysis:
A-S1: The input is either from a trusted source or verified using additional encoding/decoding steps.
A-S2: The deserialized object is checked for integrity, ensuring it matches expected patterns or keys.
A-S3: If the validation passes, the object is safely processed; otherwise, an error is raised.

Decision:
The patched code mitigates deserialization attacks by verifying and restricting deserialization operations to trusted data.
