Overview:
The function hashes a user-provided password using MD5 and stores the hash.

Sub-components:
S1: Accept a plaintext password from the user.
S2: Hash the password using the MD5 algorithm.
S3: Store or display the resulting hash.

Analysis:
A-S1: The plaintext password is directly processed without any enhancements like salting.
A-S2: MD5 is used for hashing, which is insecure due to its vulnerability to collision and brute force attacks.
A-S3: The same password will always produce the same hash, enabling precomputed attacks like rainbow tables.

Decision:
The vulnerable code fails to use a secure cryptographic algorithm and lacks measures to defend against modern attack methods.
