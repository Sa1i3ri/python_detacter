Overview:
The function creates a file and writes sensitive information to it.

Sub-components:
S1: Create the file with system default permissions.
S2: Write sensitive data to the file.

Analysis:
A-S1: The file is created without explicitly setting permissions, relying on system defaults.
A-S2: If the system umask is permissive, other users may have read or write access to the file.

Decision:
The vulnerable code risks exposing sensitive data due to insecure default permissions.
