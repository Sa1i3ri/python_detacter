The filename is validated to block .., /, and \, and the filepath is checked to ensure it starts with the absolute path of /uploads/. These measures mitigate path traversal attacks. However, the validation may miss certain edge cases, such as encoded or obfuscated payloads, potentially allowing unauthorized file deletion if the sanitization is bypassed.
