The `filename` is validated to block `..`, `/`, and `\`, and the `filepath` is checked to ensure it starts with the absolute path of `/var/files/`. These measures mitigate path traversal attacks. However, edge cases like encoded characters or symbolic links could potentially bypass these checks, leading to unauthorized file access and download.
