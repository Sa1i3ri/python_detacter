The filename is partially validated by checking for .., /, and \ in the user input and ensuring the constructed filepath starts with the absolute path of /var/logs/. However, this validation is insufficient because additional edge cases or encodings might bypass the checks. A user could exploit these limitations to attempt directory traversal attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized file access if the validation logic is incomplete.
