The `encrypt_data` function securely encrypts data using AES in GCM mode, which is a secure choice for encryption as it provides both confidentiality and integrity. The use of a random key and nonce generated by `get_random_bytes` ensures that encryption is secure and resistant to replay attacks. This implementation adheres to cryptographic best practices.
