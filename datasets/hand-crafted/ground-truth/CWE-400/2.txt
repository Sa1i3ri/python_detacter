The `process_input` function processes user input by converting it to uppercase. While this code is functionally safe, the use of `result += char.upper()` in a loop is inefficient for large inputs, as string concatenation in this manner is computationally expensive. Using a more efficient approach, such as `result = user_input.upper()`, would improve performance without altering the functionality.
