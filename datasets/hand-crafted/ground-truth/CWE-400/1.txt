The `file.filename` is directly used to construct the `filepath` without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to provide filenames containing `../` sequences or other special characters to perform path traversal attacks, potentially overwriting critical files on the server. Proper sanitization of the filename, such as using `os.path.basename` or a secure library, should be implemented to prevent such vulnerabilities.
