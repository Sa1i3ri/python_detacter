The `main` function includes a validation step to ensure that the number of threads does not exceed a defined maximum (`MAX_THREADS = 10`), which prevents resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks. This validation improves security and stability. However, the `worker` function runs an infinite loop, which may still lead to high CPU usage even with a limited number of threads. Implementing a termination condition for the threads or limiting their runtime would further enhance safety.
