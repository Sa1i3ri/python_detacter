The application restricts file uploads to a maximum size of 10 MB using `request.content_length` in the `check_file_size` function, which helps prevent excessively large file uploads that could lead to resource exhaustion. However, the `file.filename` is not sanitized, which allows potential path traversal attacks by including malicious file paths in the filename. To enhance security, the filename should be sanitized using `os.path.basename` or a secure library to prevent unauthorized file overwrites or directory traversal attacks.
