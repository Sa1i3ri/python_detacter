The database `examples.db` is created without restricting access permissions, which may allow unauthorized users or processes to access or modify the database file. If the file permissions are too permissive, sensitive data stored in the `sensitive_data` table could be exposed. Setting restrictive file permissions using `os.chmod` or configuring the database in a secure location is recommended.
