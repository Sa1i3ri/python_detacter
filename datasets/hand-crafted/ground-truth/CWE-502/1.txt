The use of `pickle.loads` to deserialize user-provided `serialized_data` poses a significant security risk. An attacker could craft malicious serialized input to execute arbitrary code during deserialization, leading to remote code execution. To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using `pickle` for untrusted input. Instead, use safer serialization formats like JSON, which do not allow code execution.
