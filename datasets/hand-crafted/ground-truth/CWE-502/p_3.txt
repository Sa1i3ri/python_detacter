The use of `defusedxml.ElementTree.fromstring` ensures that XML data is securely parsed, as `defusedxml` protects against XML External Entity (XXE) attacks and other XML-related vulnerabilities. This implementation adheres to best practices for handling user-provided XML data. Additionally, the `try` block catches exceptions, providing robust error handling for invalid XML input. This approach is secure and effective for processing XML data.
