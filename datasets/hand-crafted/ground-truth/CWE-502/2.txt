The use of `yaml.load` with `yaml.Loader` to parse user-provided `yaml_data` is insecure. `yaml.load` can execute arbitrary code if the input contains malicious YAML, leading to remote code execution vulnerabilities. To mitigate this risk, use `yaml.safe_load` instead of `yaml.load` when processing untrusted input, as `yaml.safe_load` restricts the parsing to safe YAML constructs and prevents code execution.
