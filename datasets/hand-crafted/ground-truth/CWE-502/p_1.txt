The use of `json.loads` to deserialize user-provided `serialized_data` is secure as JSON is a safe serialization format that does not allow execution of arbitrary code. Additionally, the `try` block appropriately handles `JSONDecodeError`, ensuring that invalid JSON input results in a proper error response. This implementation adheres to best practices for processing user-provided data.
