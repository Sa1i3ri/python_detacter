The use of `yaml.safe_load` to parse `yaml_data` is secure, as `safe_load` restricts the YAML parsing to safe constructs and prevents the execution of arbitrary code, mitigating risks such as remote code execution or unsafe deserialization. Additionally, the `try` block appropriately handles `YAMLError`, ensuring robust error handling for malformed input. This implementation follows best practices for safely processing user-provided YAML.
