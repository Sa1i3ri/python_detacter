The use of `xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring` to parse user-provided `xml_data` is potentially vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker could craft XML input that references external entities or resources, leading to unauthorized access to local files or denial of service. To mitigate this risk, disable external entity processing by using a more secure XML parser, such as `defusedxml`, which is specifically designed to prevent XXE and other XML-based vulnerabilities. Replace `ET.fromstring` with `defusedxml.ElementTree.fromstring` to enhance security.
